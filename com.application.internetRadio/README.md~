The project is developed using Enyo, an open source Ui library for developing applications. Enyo provides lot of features with a proper MVC framework for easy development.
All developers are free to get the code and make changes. 

Features like "search radio", "like a music","make account in 8tracks to upload" and others have not yet been implemented however if you are interested you can try to implement any new features of your choice and commit here and we will add you to the developers list as well.

We will run this app on android and windows phone to check its compatibility.

You can take it as a learning ground for enyo MVC if not interested in contributing.

Note: This project contatins the source file of the application only and not the whole bootplate.
Steps to run this app:

2) Copy the source and assets folder from this application to the respective folders in bootplate.
